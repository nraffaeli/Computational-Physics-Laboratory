# Computational Physics Laboratory

This repository contains material and code developed for the
**Computational Physics Laboratory** course, the corse is aimed to compute quantum observable by discretizing the continous theory on a Lattice.

## Structure

- `HO/`  
  Harmonic Oscillator related exercises and simulations

- `QCDanomalies/`  
  Numerical studies related to QCD anomalies

## Requirements

- C compiler (gcc or clang)
- Make
- Unix-like environment (Linux / macOS)

## Notes

- External libraries **openQCD** are intentionally excluded
  from version control. The version used is **openQCD-1.4**
- Test runs, numerical outputs and archive files (`.tar`, `.tar.gz`)
  are ignored via `.gitignore`.
